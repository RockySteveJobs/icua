iCua is my Specialist Project and it's an aplication to Android Relase 1.0 to play music.

iCua Blog http://devil-icua.blogspot.com

The first idea to develop iCua was this :

When you go with a friend in the underground,why you can't linsten the same music? iCua is an Android Media player,to listen audio files/streams,share files,chat,ratings,favourite stations, stats and all this stuff with other android phones.

Now my Goal is at iCua 1.0 have this:

- Play music on the sdcard, Save artist, album, title on the library, add Cover art and artist art.

- Navigate throught the library over artists or albumbs, and make your own playlists.

- LastFM integration, with your LastFM's username you can send the songs that you listen to your profile, You send the Playing now state too.

- You can search a radiostation of Lastf, and listen it getting the cover and metadata.( you can listen groups similars than your favourites)

- You can listen some Stream on the internet in your phone

- ListenTogether first version, play yout music an share to your friends, it's gonna be testing version, because is too dificult test with wifi-LAN configuration on the emulator

Everybody's free to join us to the Project


This is the same project than iCua on Sourceforge, when it's gonna be stable i'll keep updated.
